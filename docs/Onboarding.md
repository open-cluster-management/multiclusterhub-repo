# Onboarding 

This document is intended to be a guide to enable developers who would like to add a chart component to multiclusterhub-repo. Charts deployed via multiclusterhub-repo are expected meet a certain standard. This includes being properly validated and being able to accept certain values and overrides from the multiclusterhub-controller. To properly onboard a component, developers should ensure their associated images, CRDs, and charts are properly integrated.

## Prereqs

### Onboarding Images

For help onboarding images into the pipeline, please see the following [https://github.com/stolostron/cicd-docs/blob/main/prow/onboarding.md]().

### Onboarding CRDs

We do not allow for CRDs to be installed or managed via helm. All CRDs must be removed from the charts before onboarding.

To enable CRDs to be installed, upgraded, and uninstalled properly, ensure your CRD(s) are added to the [hub-crds](https://github.com/stolostron/hub-crds) repository. 

See [Contributing.md](https://github.com/stolostron/multiclusterhub-repo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help contributing to this repository.

## Onboarding a Chart

In order for a chart to be onboarded properly, ensure your chart meets the specifications below. 

The chart repository must be public and must be inside the github.com/stolostron organization. If creating a new repo from scratch, this repository must be approved by the organization.

The chart must be valid and helm linted.

### Fast Forwarding and Release branches

A charts GitHub repository must be enabled with fast forwarding to release branches to ensure that our automation is able to pick up new updates to the chart across multiple versioned branches. See the following [doc](https://github.com/stolostron/cicd-docs/blob/main/prow/onboarding.md#onboarding-a-repo-to-openshift-ci) to ensure your charts GitHub repository is onboarded properly.

### Contributing a Chart

Before beginning to onboard your chart, please see our [contributing.md](https://github.com/stolostron/multiclusterhub-repo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Follow the steps here for to ensure that the repo owners are aware of the desired change and can handle the desired change in a standard fashion. An issue must be created to ensure this can be tracked, as changes are also required in the MultiClusterHub Operator, to create an Application Subscription when installing the MCH.

### Service Account

A chart must not use the default service account. Instead it must be sure to create its own service account. This is done to ensure that each chart is properly managing its permissions and privileges.

### Referencing an image in a chart

Images must be added under `global.imageOverrides` in the values.yaml file of a chart. Each image referenced in the chart, must have an accompanying image key. A chart must also accept `global.imageOverrides.pullPolicy` value. This should default to a preset of `Always`. The Image key will be available after the image has been successfully [onboarded](#onboarding-images). We do not allow for static image pinning in charts, images must be overrideable.

```yaml
# Source: nginx/values.yaml
global:
  imageOverrides:
    ## Image Key/Value pairs
    nginx: "repository.to/nginx-image:latest"
    pullPolicy: Always
```

Images can be referenced in a deployment like so -

```yaml
# Source: nginx/templates/deployment.yaml
containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: {{ .Values.global.imageOverrides.nginx }}
    imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.global.pullPolicy }}
```

### Replica Count

Unless a replicaCount of 1 is always desirable, it is necessary to add `hubconfig.replicaCount` to the values.yaml file. This will allow the MCH CR to toggle between basic and high availability installation modes.

```yaml
# Source: nginx/values.yaml

hubconfig:
  replicaCount: 1
```

replicaCount can be referenced in a deployment like so -

```yaml
# Source: nginx/templates/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ template "nginx.fullname" . }}-console-v2
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.hubconfig.replicaCount }}
...
```

### Affinity

Affinity must be set in a charts deployment(s) like shown below. Ensure the `ocm-antiaffinity-selector` labels is set and that the value of this label is unique to your chart. We require affinity to be specified as follows below to prefer that pods are scheduled onto correct nodes when deploying in High Availability(HA) mode.

```yaml
# Source: nginx/templates/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        ocm-antiaffinity-selector: <ANTIAFFINITY-SELECTOR>  # Add this label
        ...
    spec:
      ...
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          ...
        podAntiAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 70
            podAffinityTerm:
              topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
              labelSelector:
                matchExpressions:
                - key: ocm-antiaffinity-selector
                  operator: In
                  values:
                  - <ANTIAFFINITY-SELECTOR>  # Add this label
                - key: component
                  operator: In
                  values:
                  - <ANTIAFFINITY-SELECTOR>  # Add this label
          - weight: 35
            podAffinityTerm:
              topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
              labelSelector:
                matchExpressions:
                - key: ocm-antiaffinity-selector
                  operator: In
                  values:
                  - <ANTIAFFINITY-SELECTOR>  # Add this label
                - key: component
                  operator: In
                  values:
                  - <ANTIAFFINITY-SELECTOR>  # Add this label
            ...
```

### Tolerations

Tolerations must be set in a charts deployment(s). These values do not need changed or altered. We require the  tolerations be set to ensure pods are deployed properly onto infrastructure nodes.

```yaml
# Source: nginx/templates/deployment.yaml
tolerations:
  - key: dedicated
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
    operator: Exists
```

### Node Selector

In the values.yaml file of a chart, there must be a `hubconfig.nodeSelector` key. This should be given a value of `null` to start. Overrides to nodeSelector are applied from the MCH CR and are passed down to each chart through this key, allowing a user to select which nodes the pods will be deployed upon.

```yaml
# Source: nginx/values.yaml
org: open-cluster-management

hubconfig:
  nodeSelector: null
```

```yaml
# Source: nginx/templates/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      containers:
        ...
      {{- with .Values.hubconfig.nodeSelector }}
      nodeSelector:
      {{ toYaml . | indent 8 }}
      {{- end }}
```

### Naming ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings

Clusterroles and clusterrolebindings installed as part of open-cluster-management require a prefix specifying their hierarchy/ownership to avoid conflicts and standardize. This should be formatted  in a way that is `<org-name>:<release-name>:<clusterrole/clusterrolebinding-name>`. A full clusterrole name should resemble the following - `open-cluster-management:nginx-chart-72fa7:clusterrole`.

```yaml
# Source: nginx/values.yaml
org: open-cluster-management
```

See [clusterrole.yaml](nginx/templates/clusterrole.yaml) and [clusterrolebinding.yaml](nginx/templates/clusterrolebinding.yaml)

### Security Policies

The following security policies must be specified in the deployments, unless an exemption is approved. This is done to minimize security risks and attack vectors.

```yaml
# Source: nginx/templates/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      hostNetwork: false
      hostPID: false
      hostIPC: false
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          ...
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            capabilities:
              drop:
              - ALL
            privileged: false
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          ...
```

### Global HTTP Proxy Configurations

Global HTTP proxy configurations must be read into each component if they are passed down from the hub. This is done to ensure that proxy support is respected if it is [configured](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/operators/admin/olm-configuring-proxy-support.html). If the proxyConfigs map is empty, no enviornment variables will be passed down to the deployments. When a proxy is configured, the hub deployment passes down the 3 preconfigured proxy environment variables (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY) to the appsub, so they can be utilized. Adding this is the first step in ensuring proxy configuration is supported. Components are expected to do their due diligence to ensure their components function properly with the global configuration if they utilize a proxy.

```yaml
hubconfig:
  proxyConfigs: {}
```

In each deployment, the following HTTP Proxy environment variables can be read in as shown below.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          env:
            - name: DEBUG_LEVEL
              value: "info"
            {{- if .Values.hubconfig.proxyConfigs }}
            - name: HTTP_PROXY
              value: {{ .Values.hubconfig.proxyConfigs.HTTP_PROXY }}
            - name: HTTPS_PROXY
              value: {{ .Values.hubconfig.proxyConfigs.HTTPS_PROXY }}
            - name: NO_PROXY
              value: {{ .Values.hubconfig.proxyConfigs.NO_PROXY }}
            {{- end }}
            ...
```

### Other

In some specific cases, a chart may require an override to be set in the Multiclusterhub CR to enable it to be passed down to the chart. In these cases, please open an issue describing the desired capability against the installer team for feedback.
